**🤖 Machine Learning Classification Project**

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to classify data into distinct categories. It includes end-to-end steps from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

**🎯 Objective:**

To build a classification model that accurately predicts the target variable using a labeled dataset. The process involves exploring the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, training various ML models, and evaluating performance using standard metrics.

**🗂 Projects:**
1) Stroke Prediction :
     A model that predicts the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on a patient’s demographic and medical history data. It applies classification techniques to assist in        early detection and preventive care.

**🛠 Tools & Technologies:**

Language: Python 3.x

**Libraries:**

> pandas, numpy – Data manipulation & numeric calculation

> matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

> scikit-learn – Machine learning models and preprocessing

> xgboost / lightgbm (if applicable)

**📈 Workflow:**

> Data Loading & Exploration

> Missing Value Handling

> Encoding Categorical Variables

> Feature Selection / Engineering

> Train-Test Split

> Model Training (KNN, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)

> Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)

> Hyperparameter Tuning

> Prediction & Inference

**📊 Evaluation Metrics:**

> Accuracy

> Confusion Matrix

> Precision, Recall, F1-score

> ROC-AUC Curve

> Cross-validation scores

> ⚠️ Class imbalance handling techniques like SMOTE or class weighting may be used to improve minority class prediction.

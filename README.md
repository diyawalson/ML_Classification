**ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Classification Project**

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to classify data into distinct categories. It includes end-to-end steps from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

**ðŸŽ¯ Objective:**

To build a classification model that accurately predicts the target variable using a labeled dataset. The process involves exploring the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, training various ML models, and evaluating performance using standard metrics.

**ðŸ—‚ Projects:**
1)Stroke Prediction

**ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:**

Language: Python 3.x

**Libraries:**

> pandas, numpy â€“ Data manipulation & numeric calculation
